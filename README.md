# Contribe
<b> Test project - Book Store </b>


I have completed this test project as much as possible (without admin panel), Where you can see the list of books under 
different category, prices, also you can order, remove from Cart.

Also, the search functionality is created, It allows you to find your favorites books by passing author name or title.

I have used latest version of MVC framework and Visual Studio 2015 for the development. There is no database created.

You can find the entire source code from following GitHub repository - https://github.com/devangsa/Contribe.git  and its open to everyone.

<b>How to run the Project:</b>

1) Once you downloaded the project from above location, you can run the application without any restriction. 
2) Please ensure you have set "ContribeBookStore" project as default startup if it's not applied already.

I was trying to work on Administrator in order to customize this project, but i would need more time from now.

Please let me know if you have any question around this.   

Thank you for your time.
